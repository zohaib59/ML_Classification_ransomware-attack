# ML_Classification_ransomware-attack
# 🛡️ Ransomware Detection using Machine Learning

This project is a powerful and interactive **Streamlit web app** that detects ransomware attacks using supervised machine learning models.

🚀 It uses **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree**, and **Naive Bayes** classifiers to predict the presence of ransomware based on input features. The models are evaluated with a focus on **ROC and AUC curves** for deeper model performance understanding.

## 🧠 Key Features

- ✅ Multiple classification models
- 📈 ROC Curve & AUC Comparison
- 📊 Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1
- 🧪 Model interpretability with visual metrics
- 🌐 Easy-to-use web interface with Streamlit

## 📌 Technologies Used

- Python (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib)
- Streamlit for UI
- Matplotlib for ROC Visualization

## 🔍 Summary

In a world increasingly targeted by **ransomware attacks**, this machine learning app provides a robust, fast, and visual way to classify ransomware incidents. It uses **AI to safeguard digital infrastructure** by detecting threats before they escalate.

Whether you're a **data scientist**, **cybersecurity analyst**, or a **tech enthusiast**, this project will help you understand the power of ML in cybersecurity.
